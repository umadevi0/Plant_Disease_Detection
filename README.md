**Plant Disease Detection in Apple Leaves using U-Net**

This repository contains the implementation of a U-Net and Resnet architectures for the task of plant disease detection in apple leaves. The U-Net model is designed for multi-class classification, where it classifies each pixel in an input image into one of the 12 disease classes. This README provides an overview of the project, model architecture, usage instructions, and other relevant information.

**Project Overview**

Plant disease detection is a critical task in agriculture as it helps in early disease identification and prevention. This project focuses on detecting diseases in apple leaves, a common issue faced by apple growers. The U-Net architecture is chosen for its ability to perform image segmentation, which is suitable for pixel-level classification tasks.

**Requirements**

Python 3.x
TensorFlow (or any deep learning framework)
Required Python packages (NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.)
